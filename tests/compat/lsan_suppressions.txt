# LSAN suppressions for known baseline leaks that are not specific to the CR-compat
# regression components under test.
#
# Keep this list as small as possible. The goal is to allow component-level tests
# (Solo/SoloReadBarcode/Transcriptome/Genome/PackedReadInfo) to fail loudly if they
# introduce new leaks, while tolerating existing leaks in the parameters plumbing.
